## Challenges for Learning And Programming

Welcome!  I hope everyone is staying healthy!  To aid with learning (primarily python, but I may work some other stuff in using python) we are going to do programming challenges!  I will commit a programming challenge each week to this github.  Each challenge will have its own folder with a .txt file with the challenge.  Upload files to the folder at any point, using github you can change them at any point, including after our Zoom sessions.

## Rules
1. Of course there is no way to prevent you just looking up the solution, however these will be far more useful if you are actually able to figure out the algorithm yourself.  Of course please do look up syntax information as needed.  Very useful: looking up how to write a general function using python.  Not useful: looking up how to write the specific function that the challenge is about.

2. Try to do the challenge on your own.  Do not worry if you can't figure out the challenge on your own.  This is a learning experience to engage you with python.  We will have Zoom meetings to discuss everyone's code once it's submitted so we can all learn from everyone's coding styles.  This is supposed to be optional, fun and educational!  Plus, plagarism = bad.

3. Please save your script as "lastname#.py" where the number is whatever number challenge we are on.  This way I can run all the scripts and provide feedback, hints, etc.  I will create a new folder for each challenge.

4. To practice professional coding practices, at the top of every script you submit (before your "import" statements) have 3 commented lines.
	1. Programmer: Name (First and Last)
	2. Title of Challenge
	3. Brief summary of what script does
