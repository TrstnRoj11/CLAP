# Challenge 1: Github Down to Business (to defeat the Huns!)

The first challenge is more or less just getting set up for the first real challenge that I will post on Friday!

## Challenge Tasks:

1. Create a Github account
2. Send me your username via slack so I can enable editing in the github repository
3. Clone the Github Repo to a folder on your computer (using the desktop app or terminal interface), make sure it's the whole repo, not just this folder.
4. Write a python script that prints out a witty or funny message.
5. Using Add/Commit/Push add your script to the repo in the appropriate folder.
6. If you haven't already, make a zoom account.

I will set up a zoom meeting for Friday so we can go through these!

The Physics must go on!
